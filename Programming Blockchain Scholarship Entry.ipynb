With each iteration, *min_diff* is checked to see if it is greater than the previous *min_diff* entry, saving the input BTC values used simultaneously. Since all of the differences which satisfy the *if* statement are less than zero the inputs that provide the lowest-magnitude-negative value thus provide the minimum change output for the payment. Because of this method, a large magnitude negative value must be initialised to ensure scalability of the function for larger value targets/inputs, unlike this example question. *-21 million (BTC)* was used as a safe option since there can never be Bitcoin over this value.\n",
