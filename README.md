**London - Programming Blockchain Scholarship Entry**

Here is my Jimmy Song's - Programming Blockchain Scholarship Entry for the London master classes.

For context, the aim here is to produce a Python function capable of selecting two Bitcoin amounts from a list of possible Bitcoin that I control (inputs) that is able to pay someone exactly 0.71 BTC (target), keeping the change output to a minimum.

The modules *'NumPy'* and *'Random'* were chosen to simplify creating a list, or an array in this case, filled with random BTC inputs, that in this scenario, I have control of.
